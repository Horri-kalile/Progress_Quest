   * ### Probability Overview (base rates):
   * - Fight:        20%
   * - Magic:         5%
   * - Craft:         5%
   * - Power:        10%
   * - Mission:      20%
   * - ChangeWorld:  10%
   * - Training:     10%
   * - Restore:       5%
   * - Sell:          5%
   * - Special:  Dynamic; increases with luck
   * - GameOver: Dynamic; decreases with luck
   *
   * ### Special Notes:
   * - `specialChance` scales *up* with luck
   * - `gameOverChance` scales *down* with luck
   *
   * If none of the above thresholds are matched, falls back to `training`.
   *
   * @param lucky The player's `lucky` attribute (0â€“100+)
   * @return A randomly chosen [[EventType]] with luck-adjusted weighting
